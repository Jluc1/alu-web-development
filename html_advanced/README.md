![Project Image](project_image.jpg)

## Introduction

Welcome to this  project in which we'll be tasked with implementing a webpage's HTML structure from a designer file. This project focuses solely on the HTML markup, with no CSS or styling involved. The goal is to create a semantic and structured HTML representation of the design provided in Figma.

## Project Details

### Designer File

The designer file for this project is available on Figma. You may need to create a Figma account to access the design details. The file can be found at the following link:

[Designer File on Figma](link_to_figma)

### Fonts

Ensure that you have the necessary fonts installed on your computer. If any fonts are missing, you can find them here:

- [Source Sans Pro](link_to_source_sans_pro)
- [Spin Cycle OT](link_to_spin_cycle_ot)

### Values

Some values in the designer file might be in float format. Feel free to round these values as needed to make them suitable for HTML.

## Project Tasks

In this project, your primary focus will be on creating the HTML structure that accurately represents the design provided in Figma. You should aim for semantic HTML, using appropriate HTML tags to structure the content.

## Getting Started

To begin, follow these steps:

1. Access the designer file on Figma (if you haven't already) to familiarize yourself with the design.
2. Install any required fonts on your computer.
3. Use the design details as a reference to create the HTML structure.

## Project Submission

Once you have completed the HTML structure according to the designer file, you can submit your work for review or further development.

## Additional Notes

- Remember that this project is focused on HTML markup only; no CSS or styling is required.
